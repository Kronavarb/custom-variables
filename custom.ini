[Mod Settings]

DelayToRead      = 500        # Add a wait time to this mod be activated. - So if other mod changes a value in your game als imposed in this mod, with a wait time, the other mod will set the value and so Mix Sets will set it, so overwriting the other mod made.  [use -1 to ignore the time and enable it immediately]
ReloadCommand    = SETS       # Command to reload the settings inside your game (use only 4 chars). - E.g. put here "SETS" and when you type "SETS" in-game this file will reloaded - !!!IMPORTANT!!!: A lot of function can't be reloaded in-game! Basically, that ask for specific number will reload, but generally functions to enable/disable not.
InGameLanguage   = 2          # Language for MixSets warnings in-game.  ["1" = Português | "2" = English]  -  Note: If you speak other language (por exemplo se você fala português), check other folders that comes in official download.
CheckEXE         = 1          # Check you .exe version - The mod only works in "Crack 1.0 US", if you're not using, will be alerted, download it and install. - Only disable this function if you think that is giving "false-positive".

#- Auto-reload
AutoRldEnable    = 0          # Forcing this file to be automatically reloaded during the game (and invisibly, without message on screen). This helps if other mods is re-setting that this mod did.
AutoRldDelay     = 60000      # Wait time to this file be reloaded if "AutoRldEnable" enabled. Very important to use a high number as 5000 (5 secs) or 60000 (1 minute) or more. Small number as 0, 100 or 500 can increase your HDD use and can do your map not load well.
# Note: "AutoRldLimit" was removed after v3 due your use no longer be necessary.

#- Not load
NotLoadDistances = 0          # Enabling, will not load functions that increase distances and intensities of traffic etc located in section [Distances and Densities] and "WaterSquare_Size". (recommended to weak PCs, but I recommend to you put "0" here and try to edit manually the function putting the distances etc that you want, but in case of lazy, simply put "1" here)
NoCheatsInSAMP   = 1          # Enabling, if you're inside SAMP, will not load functions that can be considered cheats, even minor things. - It's not possible enable/disable this function in-game.

[System]
StreamMemoryMB   = 1024       # Memory size to be used in game (in Megabytes).  [0 to 2048 | 50 is default] - Remembering that: 1024=1GB, 2048=2GB(max)] - This function is the same "Memory Fix" that everyone knows. - High numbers may cause crash if low RAM memory and remember to use SilentPatch (1.1 build 27 or newer) to not have artefacts over the map.  {Fastman92}
FPSLimit         = AUTO       # FPS limit to enable/disable the FPS limiter in game menu.  [30 is default] - High FPS cause bugs in your game as can't walk while aim a rifle/deagle, cutscenes not ending, impossibly to dive etc. So, you can set it to "AUTO" for Mix Sets choose the best FPS dependent on their situation in the game, so decreasing FPS when necessary (when not necessary, will limit it to 60 FPS). Remembering that this function will only work if FPS limiter is enabled in game menu. To not need to decrease FPS when aiming a rifle etc, use this mod: http://bit.do/fix-aim-rifle-walk  {Junior_Djjr}
FrameDelay       = 0          # Leaving "0" will increase notably your FPS.  [14 is default] - Increase 20% - Note: Some mods as SilentPatch already comes with this FPS increase.  {Deji}
ProcessPriority  = 3          # Process priority of game. [1 up to 6 | 3 is default] - The higher the number the more your CPU will process the game over others PC processes. - DON'T USE 6 IF YOUR CPU IS SINGLE CORE, in this case 4 or 5 can do good results. If fails in commands, delay and audio bugs, let "3" or disable it. Powerfull processors can use "6" without problems, but will also have no or low FPS increase if your PC have few processes opened. - You can also change process priority in-game by pressing "Insert" + priority number (1 up to 6, e.g. Insert+5). Tip: While in game use 5 or 6, and when minimize, put in 1.  {Fabio}
AntiAliasing     = -1         # Overwrite the level of anti-aliasing. [0 up to max suported, If use above the supported value will adjust automatically to the maximum]. - Currently mod SilentPatch implemented this function in the game menu, but here you can also type "CA#A" in-game to change anti-aliasing quickly without going to menu, e.g. type "CA8A" and your anti-aliasing will change to "8". Also typing "AAI" you can see infos about your anti-aliasing as the max level suported by your PC. (Tip: If lag, increase it to do screenshots and decrease to play). If you don't want the possibly to type in-game, let "-2" here.  {DK22Pac}

Reloading this function during the game may not be as useful. I recommend restarting the game.

#- Water
# Tip: If you don't want to increase the size (to become more beautiful), or remove the square (to increase FPS), you can configure the WaterSquare_Size to the default value (the square will remain the same size), set up WaterSquare_HghL for a 40.0 and enable DisaSquareAircrf, so you will not see the square while you are tall and/or in a plane, thereby increasing the FPS while flying etc.
DisaWaterSquare  = 0          # Disables the lighter square in the water (which is around you). This square indicates the visible 3D waves, but originally the game has a bug that makes them clearer, and so ugly. Disabling you only have visual changes, the waves continue taking you and the boats up etc usually the gameplay will not be affected and will improve a bit FPS. {Junior_Djjr}
# If the "WaterSquare_Size" function is disabled, automatically the "WaterSquare_HghL" and "DisaSquareAircrf" will be too. And if activated, you can not disable in-game.  {Junior_Djjr}
WaterSquare_Size = 100.0      # Size of the square, the higher the farther you will see the waves and consequently less you will notice this clearer Square by water. Beware, as increasing too decreases the FPS! [The standard is 40.0 increase to 200.0 much improvement and loses little FPS. Use -1 to disable]  {Junior_Djjr}
WaterSquare_HghL = 50.0       # Add height limit to see the lighter square in the water (the waves). This can increase FPS if you're flying or at a high altitude, especially if you increased square size.  {Junior_Djjr}
DisaSquareAircrf = 1          # Disable while you're in an airplane (except Skimmer and Sea Sparrow). After all, while you are flying you don't see the waves, then you can turn to get some FPS.  {Junior_Djjr}


[Vehicle Lights]
# All functions of car headlights were moved to the mod Enhanced ParticleTXD (plus newly added). Download the mod here: http://bit.do/enhanced-particletxd

#------------ CUSTOM FUNCTIONS ------------#
# You can create your custom functions here.
#
# What you need:
# - A memory address. (a direct address that can be written, like 0x8CDEE4 (or 0x008CDEE4 or 8CDEE4 or $8CDEE4 etc)(not offsets like CVehicle+0xC4, +1069 etc). - You can found some memory addresses, e.g. here: http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=Memory_Addresses_%28SA%29 or here: http://gtaforums.com/topic/194199-documenting-gta-sa-memory-adresses (Logically, only some addresses make sense to use).
# - Know how many Bytes have in this address [1 Byte(Byte), 2 Bytes(Word), 4 Bytes(Dword) or Float(numbers like 0.0, 1.0) etc]. If you don't know, you can try to guess, but may cause crashes.
# Note: Is acceptable hexadecimal values (0x), but if you have problems, convert hexadecimal to decimal (see Google) and use the decimal number here.
#
# Example:
# "0xB7CE50 - [dword] Money" - This address have 4 Bytes(Dword) and is stored a number on it, this number is the player's money.
#
# How add more functions:
# - Below, an example of a function that changes the money to 100000, to add more functions copy everything and do the exact same thing, and change the "[1]" to "[2]", then "[3]" respectively. The limit is 25 functions! (up to [25]).
# - Remember to remove the "#" of "#[1]" to the function be loaded!
#

#[1]
Address  = 0xB7CE50    # Memory address.
Size     = D           # Number of Bytes to be written. - You can put the number of Bytes or use shortcut letters as: B=1 Byte | W=2 Bytes | D=4 Bytes | F=Float (Remember of Float numbers (0.0, 1.0 etc) have 4 Bytes, but is necessary to use "F" here to say that this is a Float).
Value    = 100000      # Value to been written in this address.
